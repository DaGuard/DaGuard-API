# Getting Started
All API requests shall go through the DaGuard Station that runs as a service at your own data center. After the organization and user permissions are set up at DaGuard site, wallets can ONLY be created through DaGuard Station to ensure you have ultimate control of two private keys and keep them within your network. The DaGuard Station also handles all the client-side operations before submitting them to DaGuard through secured API.

## Prerequisites
Before using DaGuard Station, please make sure you have done the following things:

1. **Create an API key**
2. **Install Java Runtime Environment**
3. **Install and Start DaGuard Station**

* **API-KEY-PASSPHRASE**  (Provided by user and daguard stores the salted hash of the passphrase to further secure the api access)
